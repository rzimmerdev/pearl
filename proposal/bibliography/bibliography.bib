  abstract                   = {We propose a microstructural modeling framework for studying optimal
   market-making policies in a FIFO (first in first out) limit order book
   (order book). In this context, the limit orders, market orders, and
   cancel orders arrivals in the order book are modeled as point processes
   with intensities that only depend on the state of the order book. These
   are high-dimensional models which are realistic from a micro-structure
   point of view and have been recently developed in the literature. In
   this context, we consider a market maker who stands ready to buy and
   sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price,
   and identifies the strategies that maximize their P\&L penalized by
   their inventory. An extension of the methodology is proposed to solve
   market-making problems where the orders arrivals are modeled using
   Hawkes processes with exponential kernel. We apply the theory of Markov
   Decision Processes and dynamic programming method to characterize
   analytically the solutions to our optimal market-making problem. The
   second part of the paper deals with the numerical aspect of the
   high-dimensional trading problem. We use a control randomization method
   combined with quantization method to compute the optimal strategies.
   Several computational tests are performed on simulated data to
   illustrate the efficiency of the computed optimal strategy. In
   particular, we simulated an order book with constant/ symmetric/
   asymmetrical/ state dependent intensities, and compared the computed
   optimal strategy with naive strategies. Some codes are available on

   order book simulator, we build a reinforcement learning OpenAI gym
   environment and utilize it to simulate a realistic trading environment
   for NASDAQ equities based on historic order book messages. To train a
   trading agent that learns to maximize its trading return in this
   environment, we use Deep Dueling Double Q-learning with the APEX
   (asynchronous prioritized experience replay) architecture. The agent
   observes the current limit order book state, its recent history, and a
   short-term directional forecast. To investigate the performance of RL
   for adaptive trading independently from a concrete forecasting
   algorithm, we study the performance of our approach utilizing synthetic
   alpha signals obtained by perturbing forward-looking returns with
   varying levels of noise. Here, we find that the RL agent learns an
   effective trading strategy for inventory management and order placing
   that outperforms a heuristic benchmark trading strategy having access to
   the same signal.},

   each other. The excitation kernel of the counting process depends on the
   state process that, reciprocally, switches state when there is an event
   in the counting process. We first establish the existence and uniqueness
   of state-dependent Hawkes processes and explain how they can be
   simulated. Then we develop maximum likelihood estimation methodology for
   parametric specifications of the process. We apply state-dependent
   Hawkes processes to high-frequency limit order book data, allowing us to
   build a novel model that captures the feedback loop between the order
   flow and the shape of the limit order book. We estimate two
   specifications of the model, using the bid-ask spread and the queue
   imbalance as state variables, and find that excitation effects in the
   order flow are strongly state-dependent. Additionally, we find that the
   endogeneity of the order flow, measured by the magnitude of excitation,
   is also state-dependent, being more pronounced in disequilibrium states
   of the limit order book.},

   Book (LOB) market with a price limit and simulate and estimate its

   the percentage of the sellers in the market and the changes in the
   logarithm of the price. Moreover, we demonstrate that in this model if
   the supply and demand are equal and naturally if the demand is more than
   the supply, on the average, logarithm of the price strictly increases
   and this occurs while in the model argued, the inflation is assumed to
   be zero, no real factor exists in order to increase the value of stocks
   and no factor-like rumors enters. This conclusion implies that merely
   the normal activities of the dealers to gain profit causes a false
   increase in the stock price. This fact, as being demonstrated in the
   simulation, has also been proved analytically. We call this phenomenon
   ``the intrinsic bubble{''}. Finally, we show that if the rules of the
   market change in the way that the daily price of the stock is calculated
   by the median of the prices traded, instead of their mean, this
   intrinsic bubble will more or less disappear.},

   order book (LOB). The LOB is an event-based continuously-updating system
   that records contemporaneous demand ('bids' to buy) and supply ('asks'
   to sell) for a financial asset. Following recent successes in the
   literature that combine stochastic point processes with neural networks
   to model event stream patterns, we propose a novel state-dependent
   parallel neural Hawkes process to predict LOB events and simulate
   realistic LOB data. The model is characterized by: (1) separate
   intensity rate modelling for each event type through a parallel
   structure of continuous time LSTM units; and (2) an event-state
   interaction mechanism that improves prediction accuracy and enables
   efficient sampling of the event-state stream. We first demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed model over traditional stochastic or deep
   learning models for predicting event type and time of a real world LOB
   dataset. Using stochastic point sampling from a well trained model, we
   then develop a realistic deep learning-based LOB simulator that exhibits
   multiple stylized facts found in real LOB data.},

   updates, we introduce a model which accommodates the empirical
   properties of the full order book together with the stylized facts of
   lower frequency financial data. To do so, we split the time interval of
   interest into periods in which a well chosen reference price, typically
   the midprice, remains constant. Within these periods, we view the limit
   order book as a Markov queuing system. Indeed, we assume that the
   intensities of the order flows only depend on the current state of the
   order book. We establish the limiting behavior of this model and
   estimate its parameters from market data. Then, to design a relevant
   model for the whole period of interest, we use a stochastic mechanism
   that allows to switch from one period of constant reference price to
   another. Beyond enabling to reproduce accurately the behavior of market
   data, we show that our framework can be very useful for practitioners,
   notably as a market simulator or as a tool for the transaction cost
   analysis of complex trading algorithms.},

   reinforcement learning to optimize execution at cryptocurrency exchanges
   by learning optimal limit order placement strategies. Execution
   optimization is highly relevant for both professional asset managers and
   private investors as execution quality affects portfolio performance at
   economically significant levels and is the target of regulatory
   supervision. To optimize execution with deep reinforcement learning, we
   design a problem-specific training environment that introduces a
   purpose-built reward function, hand-crafted market state features and a
   virtual limit order exchange. We empirically compare state-of-the-art
   deep reinforcement learning algorithms to several benchmarks with market
   data from major cryptocurrency exchanges, which represent an ideal test
   bed for our study as liquidity costs are relatively high. In total, we
   leverage 18 months of high-frequency data for several currency pairs
   with 300 million trades and more than 3.5 million order book states. We
   find proximal policy optimization to reliably learn superior order
   placement strategies. By interacting with our simulated limit order
   exchange, it learns cryptocurrency execution strategies that are
   empirically known from established markets. Order placement becomes more
   aggressive in anticipation of lower execution probabilities, which is
   indicated by trade and order imbalances. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract                   = {Use of trading strategies to mislead other market participants, commonly
   termed market manipulation, has been identified as a major problem faced
   by present day stock markets. Although some mathematical models of
   market manipulation have been previously developed, this work presents a
   framework for manipulation in the context of a realistic computational
   model of a limit-order market.
   In this work, the Maslov (2000) limit order market model is extended to
   introduce a manipulator and technical traders. The Maslov model
   simplifies the concept of a market place for a particular stock by
   constructing a limit-order book contents which are manipulated by an
   infinite pool of uninformed traders. The developed model is considered
   in terms of market dynamics, overall profit, and detectability of the
   manipulation strategy. Concepts such as the role of supply and demand in
   determining price direction, how technical traders extract information
   from trading, and how manipulators use these principles to alter prices
   are presented via the model properties.
   Uninformed traders in the original Maslov model do not consider
   behaviour of other market participants when taking trading decisions.
   Because of this exogenous nature of uninformed traders, manipulation is
   not possible in the Maslov model. In contrast, technical traders base
   their trading on the behaviour of informed traders that are believed to
   be trading in the market. These technical traders utilise a Bayesian
   learning model to extract information from informed trading and use that
   information when making their buy/sell decisions. This behaviour of
   technical traders makes manipulation possible in our model.
   The manipulator pretends to be informed and misleads the technical
   traders in performing a ``pump and dump{''} manipulation scenario. We
   divided this manipulation strategy into three periods termed, ``ignition
   period{''}, ``momentum period{''}, and ``call-off period{''}. In the
   ignition period, the manipulator buys at higher prices (i.e., only
   market orders) giving an appearance of a higher activity causing the
   price to go up. This false signal affects technical trader behaviour and
   their demand further raises the price in the momentum period. The
   manipulator finishes his manipulation strategy in the call-off period by
   dumping his shares in a rapid rate causing the price to collapse.
   The presence of technical trading adds a persistence behaviour
   (momentum) to the Maslov prices. The manipulator profit is higher when
   there are more information seekers (i.e., technical traders) in the
   market and the presence of manipulation reduces the technical trader
   profits. We also show that the level of information asymmetry between
   buying and selling makes the manipulation possible and more profitable.
   Moreover, when technical traders believe that there exists more informed
   trading in a market, the manipulator effort required to mislead the
   market is comparatively low and hence the manipulator profit is higher.
   In future, we are planning to find evidence of real stock manipulation
   characteristics such as high volatility and low market efficiency in our
   manipulation model. There is also an opportunity to extend our model to
   study the dynamics of other price manipulation mechanisms such as
   ``marking the close{''} and ``painting the tape{''}. Moreover, measures
   such as volatility (ARCH/GARCH effects), properties of price return
   distributions, and market efficiency measures such as the Hurst exponent
   could be used to detect the manipulation period.},

   Poorly calibrated simulators can lead to misleading conclusions,
   potentially causing severe loss when employed by investment banks, hedge
   funds, and traders to study and evaluate trading strategies. In this
   paper, we propose a world model simulator that accurately emulates a
   limit order book market - it requires no agent calibration but rather
   learns the simulated market behavior directly from historical data.
   Traditional approaches fail short to learn and calibrate trader
   population, as historical labeled data with details on each individual
   trader strategy is not publicly available. Our approach proposes to
   learn a unique ``world{''} agent from historical data. It is intended to
   emulate the overall trader population, without the need of making
   assumptions about individual market agent strategies. We implement our
   world agent simulator models as a Conditional Generative Adversarial
   Network (CGAN), as well as a mixture of parametric distributions, and we
   compare our models against previous work. Qualitatively and
   quantitatively, we show that the proposed approaches consistently
   outperform previous work, providing more realism and responsiveness.},

   for the impact of market orders on the stock price and the emergence of
   price shocks. Limit orders are characterized by stylized facts: the
   number of inserted limit orders declines with the price distance from
   the quotes following a power law and limit order lifetimes and volumes
   are power law distributed. Strong dependencies among these quantities
   add to the complexity of limit order books. Here, we analyze the limit
   order book in the dimensions of price, time, limit order lifetime and
   volume altogether. This allows us to identify regularities that are not
   visible in marginal distributions. Particularly, we find that the limit
   order book is divided into two regimes. Around the quotes, we find a
   densely filled regime with mostly short living limit orders closely
   adapting to the price. Far away from the quotes, we find a sparse
   filling with long living limit orders, mostly inserted at particular
   times of the day being prone to flash crashes. We determine the
   characteristics of those two regimes and point out the main differences.
   Based on our research, we propose a model for simulating the regime
   around the quotes.},

   markets through spoofing: submitting spurious orders to mislead traders
   who learn from the order book. Our model captures a complex market
   environment for a single security, whose common value is given by a
   dynamic fundamental time series. Agents trade through a limit-order
   book, based on their private values and noisy observations of the
   fundamental. We consider background agents following two types of
   trading strategies: the non-spoofable zero intelligence (ZI) that
   ignores the order book and the manipulable heuristic belief learning
   (HBL) that exploits the order book to predict price outcomes. We conduct
   empirical game-theoretic analysis upon simulated agent payoffs across
   parametrically different environments and measure the effect of spoofing
   on market performance in approximate strategic equilibria. We
   demonstrate that HBL traders can benefit price discovery and social
   welfare, but their existence in equilibrium renders a market vulnerable
   to manipulation: simple spoofing strategies can effectively mislead
   traders, distort prices and reduce total surplus. Based on this model,
   we propose to mitigate spoofing from two aspects: (1) mechanism design
   to disincentivize manipulation; and (2) trading strategy variations to
   improve the robustness of learning from market information. We evaluate
   the proposed approaches, taking into account potential strategic
   responses of agents, and characterize the conditions under which these
   approaches may deter manipulation and benefit market welfare. Our model
   provides a way to quantify the effect of spoofing on trading behavior
   and market efficiency, and thus it can help to evaluate the
   effectiveness of various market designs and trading strategies in
   mitigating an important form of market manipulation.},

   as Poisson or Hawkes processes, have been studied intensively. Often,
   several days of limit border book (LOB) data is used to calibrate such
   models, thereby averaging over different dynamics such as intraday
   effects or different trading volumes.
   This work uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn the
   distribution of calibrations - obtained by many calibrations based on
   short time frames. The trained GAN can then be used to generate
   synthetic, realistic calibrations based on external conditions such as
   time of the day or volatility. Results show that GANs easily reproduce
   patterns of the order arrival intensities and can fit the distribution
   well without heavy parameter tuning.
   The synthetic calibrations can then be used to simulate order streams
   which contain new dynamics such as temporary drifts, different
   volatility regimes, but also intra-day patterns such as the commonly

   arrival times of limit and market orders following mutually
   (asymmetrically) exciting Hawkes processes. Modelling is based on
   empirical observations on time intervals between orders that we verify

   that, despite the absence of market makers, the market is resilient. All
   dimensions of liquidity (spread, depth at the best prices and order book
   imbalances) revert to their steady-state values within 15 orders after
   the shock. For prices, a long run effect is found. Furthermore,
   different dimensions of liquidity interact. Immediately after a
   liquidity shock, the spread becomes wider than in the steady state,
   implying that one dimension of liquidity deteriorates, while at the same
   time, depth at the best prices increases, meaning an improvement of
   another liquidity dimension. In subsequent periods, the spread reverts
   back to the steady-state level but also depth decreases. Also, I find
   evidence for asymmetries in the impact of shocks on the ask and bid
   side. Shocks on the ask side have a stronger impact than shocks on the
   bid side. Finally, resiliency is higher for less-frequently traded

   of a single trading day in a limit order book. Transaction costs are
   incurred because large orders walk the order book (that is, they consume
   order book liquidity beyond the best bid/ask price). We model the order
   book with a power law that is proportional to trading volume, and thus
   transaction costs are inversely proportional to a power of the trading
   volume. We obtain a policy approximation by training a long short-term
   memory (LSTM) neural network to minimize the transaction costs
   accumulated when execution is carried out as a sequence of smaller
   suborders. Using historical Standard \& Poor's 100 price and volume
   data, we evaluate our LSTM strategy relative to strategies based on the
   time-weighted average price (TWAP) and volume-weighted average price
   (VWAP). For execution of a single stock, the input to the LSTM is the
   cross-section of data on all 100 stocks, including prices, volumes,
   TWAPs and VWAPs. By using this data cross-section, the LSTM should be
   able to exploit interstock codependence in volume and price movements,
   thereby reducing transaction costs for the day. Our tests on Standard \&
   Poor's 100 data demonstrate that in fact this is so, as our LSTM
   strategy consistently outperforms TWAP- and VWAP-based strategies.},

   tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who
   continuously submits limit buy/sell orders at best bid/ask quotes, and
   may also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a
   tick for obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in
   high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her
   limit orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders.
   She is also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when
   holding the risky asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with
   market orders, and therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less
   favorable price. The objective of the market maker is to maximize her
   expected utility from revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off
   between limit and market orders, while controlling her inventory
   position. This is formulated as a mixed regime switching regular/impulse
   control problem that we characterize in terms of a quasi-variational
   system by dynamic programming methods. Calibration procedures are
   derived for estimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters
   for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the execution of limit
   orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme for solving the
   problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple equations
   involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several computational
   tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and illustrate the
   impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit orders
   and market orders.},

  abstract                   = {In an order-driven financial market, the price of a financial asset is
   discovered through the interaction of orders - requests to buy or sell
   at a particular price - that are posted to the public limit order book
   (LOB). Therefore, LOB data is extremely valuable for modelling market
   dynamics. However, LOB data is not freely accessible, which poses a
   challenge to market participants and researchers wishing to exploit this
   information. Fortunately, trades and quotes (TAQ) data - orders arriving
   at the top of the LOB, and trades executing in the market - are more
   readily available. In this paper, we present the LOB recreation model, a
   first attempt from a deep learning perspective to recreate the top five
   price levels of the LOB for small-tick stocks using only TAQ data.
   Volumes of orders sitting deep in the LOB are predicted by combining
   outputs from: (1) a history compiler that uses a Gated Recurrent Unit
   (GRU) module to selectively compile prediction relevant quote history;
   (2) a market events simulator, which uses an Ordinary Differential
   Equation Recurrent Neural Network (ODE-RNN) to simulate the accumulation
   of net order arrivals; and (3) a weighting scheme to adaptively combine
   the predictions generated by (1) and (2). By the paradigm of transfer
   learning, the source model trained on one stock can be fine-tuned to
   enable application to other financial assets of the same class with much
   lower demand on additional data. Comprehensive experiments conducted on

   application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the creation of
   intelligent market markers in simulated stock markets. This research
   analyzes how RL market maker agents behaves in non-competitive (only one
   RL market maker learning at the same time) and competitive scenarios
   (multiple RL market markers learning at the same time), and how they
   adapt their strategies in a Sim2Real scope with interesting results.
   Furthermore, it covers the application of policy transfer between
   different experiments, describing the impact of competing environments
   on RL agents performance. RL and deep RL techniques are proven as
   profitable market maker approaches, leading to a better understanding of
   their behavior in stock markets.},

   sequential auctions, where agents receive long-lived heterogeneous
   signals on the true value of an asset and with a known deadline. The
   evolution of the amount of differential information and its impact on
   the distribution of overall gains and the pace of truth discovery is
   examined for various depth levels of the limit order book (LOB). The
   paper also formulates a dynamic programming model for the problem and
   presents an associated reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for finding
   optimal strategy in exploiting informational disparity. This is done
   from the perspective of an agent whose information is superior to the
   collective information of the rest of the market. Finally, a numerical
   analysis is presented based on a futures market example to validate the
   proposed methodology for finding the optimal strategy. We find evidence
   in favor of a waiting strategy where agent does not reveal her signal
   until the last auction before the deadline. This result may help bring
   more insight into the micro-structural dynamics that work against market
   efficiency.},

  abstract                   = {Electronic markets have emerged as popular venues for the trading of a
   wide variety of financial assets, and computer based algorithmic trading
   has also asserted itself as a dominant force in financial markets across
   the world. Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic
   trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market
   operators and regulators. We propose to characterize traders' behavior
   in terms of the reward functions most likely to have given rise to the
   observed trading actions. Our approach is to model trading decisions as
   a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and use observations of an optimal
   decision policy to find the reward function. This is known as Inverse
   Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and a variety of approaches for this
   problem are known. Our IRL-based approach to characterizing trader
   behavior strikes a balance between two desirable features in that it
   captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics and yet remains
   computationally tractable. Using an IRL algorithm based on linear
   programming, we are able to achieve more than 90\% classification
   accuracy in distinguishing High Frequency Trading from other trading
   strategies in experiments on a simulated E-Mini S\&P 500 futures market.
   The results of these empirical tests suggest that High Frequency Trading
   strategies can be accurately identified and profiled based on
   observations of individual trading actions.},

   realized variance be estimated? The obvious estimator-the sum of squared
   returns between trades-is biased by microstructure effects such as
   bid-ask bounce and so in the past, practitioners were advised to drop
   most of the data and sample at most every five minutes or so. Recently,
   however, numerous alternative estimators have been developed that make
   more efficient use of the available data and improve substantially over
   those based on sparsely sampled returns. Yet, from a practical
   viewpoint, the choice of which particular estimator to use is not a
   trivial one because the study of their relative merits has primarily
   focused on the speed of convergence to their asymptotic distributions,
   which in itself is not necessarily a reliable guide to finite sample
   performance (especially when the assumptions on the price or noise
   process are violated). In this paper we compare a comprehensive set of
   nineteen realized variance estimators using simulated data from an
   artificial ``zero-intelligence{''} market that has been shown to mimic
   some key properties of actual markets. In evaluating the competing
   estimators, we concentrate on efficiency but also pay attention to
   implementation, practicality, and robustness. One of our key findings is
   that for scenarios frequently encountered in practice, the best variance
   estimator is not always the one suggested by theory. In fact, an ad hoc
   implementation of a subsampling estimator, realized kernel, or maximum
   likelihood realized variance, delivers the best overall result. We make
   firm practical recommendations on choosing and implementing a realized
   variance estimator, as well as data sampling.},

   exchanges are widely used in practice to match buyers and sellers of a
   variety of financial instruments. In this work, we develop an
   agent-based model for trading in a limit order book and show (1) how
   opponent modelling techniques can be applied to classify trading agent
   archetypes and (2) how behavioural cloning can be used to imitate these
   agents in a simulated setting. We experimentally compare a number of
   techniques for both tasks and evaluate their applicability and use in

   Artificial Stock Market. Heterogeneous agents trade a risky asset in
   exchange for cash. Agents have zero intelligence and issue random limit
   or market orders depending on their budget constraints. The price is
   cleared by means of a limit order book. A renewal order-generation
   process is used having a waiting-time distribution between consecutive
   orders that follows a Weibull law, in line with previous studies. The
   simulation results show that this mechanism can reproduce fat-tailed
   distributions of returns without ad-hoc behavioral assumptions on
   agents. In the simulated trade process, when the order waiting-times are
   exponentially distributed, trade waiting times are exponentially
   distributed. However, if order waiting times follow a Weibull law,
   analogous results do not hold. These findings are interpreted in terms
   of a random thinning of the order renewal process. This behavior is
   compared with order and trade durations taken from real financial data.},

   has not been paralleled in practice by a sophistication in IOL selection
   methods, which rely on limited anatomical measurements of the eye and
   the surgeon's interpretation of the patient's needs and expectations. We
   propose that the future of IOL selection will be guided by 3D
   quantitative imaging of the crystalline lens to map lens opacities,
   anticipate IOL position, and develop fully customized eye models for
   ray-tracing-based IOL selection. Conversely, visual simulators (in which
   IOL designs are programmed in active elements) allow patients to
   experience prospective vision before surgery and to make more informed
   decisions about which IOL to choose. Quantitative imaging and optical
   and visual simulations of postsurgery outcomes will allow optimal
   treatments to be selected for a patient undergoing modern cataract
   surgery.},

   lacking. This study models the price impact using an agent-based
   modeling approach. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether
   agent intelligence is a necessary condition when seeking to construct
   realistic price impact with an artificial market simulation. We build a
   zero-intelligence based artificial limit order market model. Our model
   distinguishes limit orders according to their order aggressiveness and
   takes into account some observed facts including log-normal distributed
   order sizes and power-law distributed limit order placements. The model
   is calibrated using trades and orders data from the London Stock
   Exchange. The results indicate that agent intelligence is needed when
   simulating an artificial market where replicating price impact is a
   concern.},

   futures market, which allows for a close examination of the market
   microstructure. Several classes of agents are characterized by their
   order speed and order placement within the limit order book. These
   agents' orders populate the simulated market in a way consistent with
   real world participation rates. By modeling separate trading classes the
   simulation is able to capture interactions between classes, which are
   essential to recreating market phenomenon. The simulated market is
   validated against empirically observed characteristics of price returns
   and volatility. We therefore conclude that our agent based simulation
   model can accurately capture the key characteristics of the nearest
   months E-Mini S\&P 500 futures market. Additionally, to illustrate the
   applicability of the simulation, experiments were run, which confirm the
   leading hypothesis for the cause of the May 6th 2010 Flash Crash.},

   biological processes such as: protein folding, ligand binding, signal
   transduction, allostery, and enzymatic catalysis. Molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations can describe the dynamics of molecules at atomic
   detail, therefore providing a much higher temporal and spatial
   resolution than most experimental techniques. Although MD simulations
   have been widely applied to study protein dynamics, the timescales
   accessible by conventional MD methods are usually limited to timescales
   that are orders of magnitude shorter than the conformational changes
   relevant for most biological functions. During the past decades great
   effort has been devoted to the development of theoretical methods that
   may enhance the conformational sampling. In recent years, it has been
   shown that the statistical mechanics framework provided by
   discrete-state and -time Markov State Models (MSMs) can predict long
   timescale dynamics from a pool of short MD simulations. In this chapter
   we provide the readers an account of the basic theory and selected
   applications of MSMs. We will first introduce the general concepts
   behind MSMs, and then describe the existing procedures for the
   construction of MSMs. This will be followed by the discussions of the
   challenges of constructing and validating MSMs, Finally, we will employ
   two biologically-relevant systems, the RNA polymerase and the
   LAO-protein, to illustrate the application of Markov State Models to
   elucidate the molecular mechanisms of complex conformational changes at
   biologically relevant timescales.},

   will ultimately help to develop a method of analyzing eye-gaze data
   which had been collected during reading activity in order to uncover
   crucial information regarding the individual's interest level and
   quality of experience while reading a passage of text or book.
   Additionally, such an approach will serve as a ``visual signature{''} a
   method of verifying if an individual has indeed given adequate attention
   to critical text based information. Further, an accurate
   ``reading-progression tracker{''} has potential applications in
   educational institutions, e-readers and parenting solutions. Tracking
   the progression of reading remains a challenging problem due to the fact
   that eye-gaze movements are highly noisy and the eye-gaze is easily
   distracted in a limited space, like an e-book. In a prior work, we
   proposed an approach to analyzing eye-gaze fixation points collected
   while reading a page of text in order to classify each measurement to a
   line of text; this approach did not consider tracking the progression of
   reading along the line of text. In this paper, we extend the
   capabilities of the previous algorithm in order to accurately track the
   progression of reading along each line. the proposed approach employs
   least squares batch estimation in order to estimate three states of the
   horizontal saccade: position, velocity and acceleration. First, the
   proposed approach is objectively evaluated on a simulated eye-gaze
   dataset. Then, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on real data
   collected by a Gazepoint eye-tracker while the subject is reading
   several pages from an electronic book.},

   impacted by speed, but faster is not always better; (b) the
   Adaptive-Aggressive (AA) algorithm, until recently considered the most
   dominant trading strategy in the literature, is outperformed by the
   simplistic Shaver (SHVR) strategy-shave one tick off the current best

   reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to portfolio
   management. However, shortcomings remain. Specifically, because the
   training environment of an RL-based portfolio optimization framework is
   usually constructed based on historical price data in the literature,
   the agent potentially 1) violates the definition of a Markov decision
   process (MDP), 2) ignores their own market impact, or 3) fails to
   account for causal relationships within interaction processes; these
   ultimately lead the agent to make poor generalizations. To surmount
   these problems-specifically, to help the RL-based portfolio agent make
   better generalizations-we introduce an interactive training environment
   that leverages a generative model, called the limit order
   book-generative adversarial model (LOB-GAN), to simulate a financial
   market. Specifically, the LOB-GAN models market ordering behavior, and
   LOB-GAN's generator is utilized as a market behavior simulator. A
   simulated financial market, called Virtual Market, is constructed by the
   market behavior simulator in conjunction with a realistic security
   matching system. Virtual Market is then leveraged as an interactive
   training environment for the RL-based portfolio agent. The experimental
   results demonstrate that our framework improves out-of-sample portfolio
   performance by 4\%, which is superior to other generalization
   strategies.},

   financial markets containing a single exchange with public limit order
   book and continuous double auction matching. In particular, we explore
   two effects: (i) reaction speed - the time taken for trading strategies
   to calculate a response to market events; and (ii) trading urgency - the
   sensitivity of trading strategies to approaching deadlines. Much of the
   literature on trading agents focuses on optimising pricing strategies
   only and ignores the effects of time, while real-world markets continue
   to experience a race to zero latency, as automated trading systems
   compete to quickly access information and act in the market ahead of
   others. We demonstrate that modelling reaction speed can significantly
   alter previously published results, with simple strategies such as SHVR
   outperforming more complex adaptive algorithms such as AA. We also show
   that adding a pace parameter to ZIP traders (ZIP-Pace, or ZIPP) can
   create a sense of urgency that significantly improves profitability.},

   dialogue policy for task-oriented dialogue systems in recent years.
   However, the high cost of interacting with users has seriously hindered
   the development of this field. In order to reduce this interaction cost,
   the Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ) algorithm and several variants introduce a
   so-called world model to simulate the user's response and then use the
   generated simulated dialogue data to train the dialogue policy.
   Nevertheless, these methods suffer from two main issues. The first is
   limited training efficiency due to the Deep-Q Network used. The second
   is that low-quality simulation dialogue data generated by the world
   model may hurt the performance of the dialogue policy. To solve these
   drawbacks, we propose the Dyna Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO)
   algorithm. DPPO combines the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
   algorithm with the world model and uses a deactivation strategy to
   decide when to stop using the world model for subsequent training. We
   have conducted experiments on the task of movie ticket booking.
   Experiments show that our algorithm combines the advantages of DDQ and
   PPO, which significantly reduces the interaction cost required during
   training and has a higher task success rate.},

   a half century. How-ever, several conflicting results have been recently
   reported. This study attempts to refine test conditions such as waveform
   type (haversine versus sinusoidal), incorporating rest periods between
   loading cycles, and the effect of rest period on the healing of the HMA
   to minimize (eliminate) gross errors in the data analysis of the fatigue
   test results. In the deflection-controlled haversine test {[}ASTM D7460,
   2010, ``Standard Test Method for Deter-mining Fatigue Failure of
   Compacted Asphalt Concrete Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending,{''}
   Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol. 04.03, ASTM International, West
   Conshohocken, PA, pp. 1-14] permanent deforma-tions lead to a new
   equilibrium neutral position of the beam and the force output follows a
   sinusoidal waveform. This tends to bend the beam in both directions
   similar to the deflection-controlled sinusoidal test. This would produce
   erroneous fatigue results since the test assumptions do not match the
   actual test conditions. In contrast, the deflection-controlled
   sinusoidal test {[}AASHTO T-321, 2012, ``Standard Method of Test for
   Deter-mining the Fatigue Life of Compacted Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA)
   Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending,{''} An-nual Book of AASHTO
   Standards, Vol. 32, Washington, DC, pp. T321-1-T321-11] is more
   consistent than the deflection-controlled haversine test {[}ASTM D7460,
   2010, ``Standard Test Method for Determining Fatigue Fail-ure of
   Compacted Asphalt Concrete Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending,{''}
   Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol. 04.03, ASTM International, West
   Conshohocken, PA, pp. 1-14]. When tests, with and without rest periods,
   are compared for healing studies, it is even more important to use a
   deflection-controlled sinusoidal test in order to obtain a fair
   comparison and accurate healing results. Since neither the haversine
   waveform nor the sinusoi-dal waveform in the lab exactly simulates field
   conditions, it is important to use a sinusoidal waveform in order to
   obtain consistent results. It is recommended that ASTM changes the ASTM
   D-7460 designation and test pro-cedure to require a
   deflection-controlled sinusoidal waveform instead of haversine.
   Implementing the recom-mended test conditions is a crucial step in
   studying the concept of HMA healing and; as a result, estimating the
   endurance limit which plays an important role in designing sustainable
   pavements.},

   Grammatical Evolution, a form of Genetic Programming, to create
   portfolio strategies on an artificial market suited to simulate market
   impact. Classical portfolio selection as introduced by Markowitz is a
   well-established method to select securities based on their underlying
   returns and variances. This framework works well in an idealized world,
   where there are no market frictions and the true returns of the assets
   are known and normally distributed. In the real world however we face a
   range of problems such as transaction costs. For an active portfolio
   manager, transaction costs can consume a substantial amount of
   information value (also called a manager's alpha). One part of the
   transaction costs which are implicit rather than explicit are market
   impact costs. There has been extensive research which looks at the
   problem of building or liquefying a given position when facing market
   impact costs but it might be beneficial to look at the problem at a
   broader perspective where the decision which assets to include into the
   portfolio has not been made. We find that on the artificial market,
   Grammatical Evolution is able to construct portfolio strategies which
   considerably outperform a linearly built-up Markowitz tangency portfolio
   by limiting the invested amount and adjusting the portfolio weights.},

  abstract                   = {In this paper we present the characteristics of a multimedia system for
   self-learning digital signal processing techniques. This system is
   called SIMAT-TDS ({''}SIstema Multimedia para el Autoaprendizaje de
   Tecnicas de Tratamiento Digital de la Senal{''}, in Spanish) and is used
   by students of Telecommunication Engineering in the University of Jaen
   (SPAIN).
   Among the features of this system, we emphasize:
   - Multi-environment: this tool can be used remotely via an Internet
   connection through a Web browser. Also it can be used ``in place{''}
   installing the application on the local hard disk of a PC. It is
   available for download online via Web and through the distribution of
   CD-ROM.
   - Flexible: it allows easily to extend-eliminate-modify the contents
   lodged at this one (electronic books, virtual laboratory, technological
   pills).
   - Adaptable: according to the knowledge level of the user, access to the
   contents is enabled or not.
   SIMAT-TDS facilitates the learning of the students. It offers the
   possibility of learning, independent both from the standpoint of time
   and place, avoiding the saturation for the overlapping with other
   students. It also provide a single meeting point for all students of the
   University of Jaen studying subjects related to Digital Signal
   Processing. This facilitates the exchange of experiences across the
   available tools (forums, surveys) for their participation.
   SIMAT-TDS becomes a powerful tool of autolearning, where the student
   finds sufficient information for the correct follow-up of the
   theoretical contents of the subjects, as well as the accomplishment of
   practices, personalizing them (you can alter the input signals, change
   the parameters of the functional blocks, simulating new systems).
   SIMAT-TDS tries to use the processing power of the computer, increasing
   the didactic diversity, as effective complement of the most conventional
   methodologies.
   It also includes a Virtual Lab that allows to the students to learn
   using the trial and error method. They can repeat the same practice
   without limit. They can be in the laboratory as long as they want, and
   choose the most significant practices to realize them as often as they
   want.
   The development of the system has led to the generation and collection
   of a large amount of multimedia contents. Each subject related with the
   digital signal processing will have electronic books, a library of
   graphical modules for their use in the virtual laboratory and some of
   what we have named ``technological pills{''}. These are short multimedia
   material where, in a very simple form, explains some techniques that are
   covered in the subject.
   Beyond the ``technological pills{''} proper of each subject, will be
   elaborated pills for people unfamiliar with engineering. The main
   recipient of these would be high school students in order to attract
   potential new students, but could also be used as divulgate material for
   general public.},

   However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems
   are characterized by several metastable states separated by high
   barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable
   states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer
   timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling
   methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem,
   including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or
   collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables.
   Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great
   variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical
   foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a
   practical tool but can also be considered an important development in
   the theory of statistical mechanics.},

   North Sea (COHERENS, CSM-NZB, DCM-NZB, DYMONNS, ECOHAM, ELISE, ERSEM,
   FYFY, GHER, NORWECOM, POLCOMS-ERSEM) showing the realism achieved as
   well as the problems hindering a better degree of validity of the
   models. Several of the models were able to reproduce observations of the
   state variables correctly within an order of magnitude, but all models
   are not capable of reproducing every simulated state variable in the
   range of observations. None of the models can be called a valid model.
   Comparison of results from different models with datasets are evaluated
   according to the different spatial and temporal scales, for which data
   products were available, namely for regional distributions, annual
   cycles, long-term developments and events. The higher the trophic level,
   the greater was the discrepancy with the data. Problems still exist in
   determining the necessary complexity of the ecosystem model. More
   complexity in the model does not necessarily improve the simulations.
   Special attention should be devoted to the regeneration mechanisms in
   the sediments. Species' groups have been simulated so far with rather
   limited success. The ecological model simulations did not reproduce
   fully the observed variability. Possible sources of lacking coincidence
   with observations originating from the spatial and temporal resolution
   of the internal dynamics, the trophic resolution, or the resolution of
   the forcing functions are discussed. Most of the models still need to be
   evaluated more intensively for their predictive potential to be judged.
   They have not yet been tested to a degree which is possible today using
   the various existing datasets from the northwest European shelf seas
   (presented in the Appendix). Common datasets for the necessary annual
   cycles of forcing functions are needed.},

  abstract                   = {Biodegradation of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP) was investigated in
   low-permeability fractured-chalk cores. Long-term (similar to 600 days)
   biodegradation experiments were conducted in two cores (similar to 21 cm
   diameter, 31 and 44 cm long, respectively) intersected by a natural
   fracture. The impact of residence time, oxygen concentration, and chalk
   characteristics (such as pore size) on biodegradation were evaluated. In
   addition, the relationship between microbial activity and fracture
   transmissivity was evaluated. The main limiting factor for TBP
   biodegradation in these experiments was oxygen availability. Although
   the matrix pore-size distribution limits microbial activity to the
   fracture void, which has a relatively low surface area with respect to
   that of the entire chalk matrix, the chalk appears to provide an
   excellent environment for biodegradation activity. TBP removal was very
   slow when the conditions were similar to those expected in contaminated
   aquitards (natural attenuation). A significant enhancement in TBP
   removal was achieved by an increase in oxygen concentration within the
   fracture and faster flow rates, simulating an in situ bioremediation
   scenario, but at the same time, the fracture's transmissivity was
   reduced due to bioclogging. Approximately 90\% of the TBP removal
   occurred within 10 cm of the TBP source, even when the residence time
   was reduced from 305 to 8 minutes and the fracture transmissivity
   decreased by up to two orders of magnitude (indicating that most of the
   biodegradation and clogging occurred near the contaminant source). The
   results obtained from this study suggest that in situ bioremediation can
   be used to accelerate the removal of organic contaminants in
   low-permeability fractured rock, if nutrient-delivery pathways within
   the aquitard are secured.},

   data for the study of protein structure and dynamics. Although very
   informative and accurate, their use has been limited because of
   challenges associated with comprehensive analyses of RDC data. The
   REDCRAFT software package has been designed to use RDCs exclusively for
   the simultaneous study of protein structure and dynamics. This has
   enabled the direct study of protein backbones and facilitated the
   fragmented study of proteins for instances where only partial data may
   be available. REDCRAFT's effective search engine has also resulted in a
   reduction in the number of RDC data required per residue to near
   theoretical limits. Here, we demonstrate the ability of REDCRAFT in
   structure determination of proteins using only backbone \{N-H,
   C-alpha-H-alpha\} RDCs from two alignment media, or \{C-N, N-H, C-H\}
   from one alignment medium and \{N-H\} from the second alignment medium.
   In addition, we present the success of REDCRAFT in identification of
   internal dynamics and its proper treatment in application to simulated

  abstract                   = {Turbulent free shear flows are subject to the well-known
   Kelvin-Helmholtz type {[}Panton RL. Incompressible flow. John Wiley and
   Sons; 1984. p. 675] instability, and it is well-known that any free
   shear flow which approximates a thin vorticity layer will be unstable to
   a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies of disturbance. In fact, much
   of what constitutes flow control in turbulent free shear layers consists
   of feeding a prescribed destabilizing disturbance to these layers. The
   question in the control of free shear flows is not whether the shear
   layer will be stable, but whether you can influence how the layer
   becomes unstable. In most cases, since these flows are so receptive to
   forcing input, and naturally tend toward instability, large changes in
   flow conditions can be achieved with very small amplitude periodic
   inputs. Recently, it has been discovered that turbulent free shear flows
   can also be stabilized using periodic forcing. This is, at first glance,
   counter-intuitive, considering our long history of considering these
   flows to be very unstable to forcing input. It is a phenomenon not
   described in modern fluid dynamic text books. The forcing required to
   achieve this effect (which we will call turbulent shear layer
   stabilization) is of a much higher amplitude and frequency than the more
   traditional type of shear layer flow control effect seen in the
   literature (which we will call turbulent shear layer destabilization). A
   numerical study is undertaken to investigate the effect of frequency of
   pulsed mass injection on the nature of stabilization, destabilization
   and acoustic suppression in high speed cavity flows. An implicit,
   2nd-order in space and time flow solver, coupled with a recently
   developed hybrid RANS-LES (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes-Large Eddy
   Simulation) turbulence model by Nichols and Nelson {[}Nichols RH Nelson
   CC. Weapons bay acoustic predictions using a multi-scale turbulence
   model. In: Proceedings of the ITEA 2001 aircraft-stores compatibility
   symposium, March 2001], is utilized in a Chimera-based parallel format.
   This tool is used to numerically simulate both an unsuppressed cavity in
   resonance, as well as the effect of mass-addition pulsed jet flow
   control on cavity flow physics and ultimately, cavity acoustic levels.
   Frequency (and in a limited number of cases, amplitude) of pulse is
   varied, from 0 Hz (steady) up to 5000 Hz. The change in the character of
   the flow control effect as pulsing frequency is changed is described,
   and linked to changes in acoustic levels. Limited comparison to 1/10th
   scale experiments is presented. The observed local stabilization of the
   cavity turbulent shear layer, when subjected to high frequency pulsed
   blowing, is shown in simulation to be the result of a violent
   instability and breakdown of a pair of opposite sign vortical structures
   created with each high frequency ``pulse{''}. This unique shear layer
   stabilization behavior is only observed in simulation above a certain
   critical pulsing frequency. Below this critical frequency, pulsing is
   shown in simulation to provide little benefit with respect to
   suppression of high cavity acoustic levels. (C) 2007 Published by

  abstract                   = {Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture in vitro has proven to be more
   physiologically relevant than two-dimensional (2D) culture of cell
   monolayers, thus more predictive in assessing efficacy and toxicity of
   compounds. There have been several 3D cell culture techniques developed,
   which include spheroid and multicellular tissue cultures. Cell spheroids
   have been generated from single or multiple cell types cultured in
   ultralow attachment (ULA) well plates and hanging droplet plates. In
   general, cell spheroids are formed in a relatively short period of
   culture, in the absence of extracellular matrices (ECMs), via
   gravity-driven self-aggregation, thus having limited ability to
   self-organization in layered structure. On the other hand, multicellular
   tissue cultures including miniature tissues derived from pluripotent
   stem cells and adult stem cells (a.k.a. `organoids') and 3D bioprinted
   tissue constructs require biomimetic hydrogels or ECMs and show highly
   ordered structure due to spontaneous self-organization of cells during
   differentiation and maturation processes. In this short review article,
   we summarize traditional methods of spheroid and multicellular tissue
   cultures as well as their technical challenges, and introduce how
   droplet-based, miniature 3D bioprinting ('microarray 3D bioprinting')
   can be used to improve assay throughput and reproducibility for
   high-throughput, predictive screening of compounds. Several platforms
   including a micropillar chip and a 384-pillar plate developed to
   facilitate miniature spheroid and tissue cultures via microarray 3D
   bioprinting are introduced. We excluded microphysiological systems
   (MPSs) in this article although they are important tissue models to
   simulate multiorgan interactions.},

  abstract                   = {Improving our understanding of the relationships between soil conditions
   and plant growth, both above and below ground, will contribute to the
   development of cropping systems that are less reliant on mineral
   fertilizers for crop nutrition. Although many models predicting the
   flows of nutrients between plants and soil have been developed, few of
   these deal in detail with root architecture and dynamics. In this
   chapter, we review seven widely cited models of root architecture and
   development in terms of their ability to improve predictions of plant
   and soil nutrient flows. We have examined processes related to root
   system architecture and development, compared mathematical expressions
   and parameters used in the selected models, and summarized common
   processes and parameters for simulating root systems. This outcome
   should benefit researchers and model developers, preventing the need to
   spend limited resources on repeating the same process.
   Detailed conclusions include the fact that both inter-branching distance
   and insertion angle are essential parameters for representing root
   architecture. Additionally, in a three-dimensional model an extra
   parameter, radial angle, should be used for determining the location of
   a branch relative to the root from which it originated. Root growth is
   simulated by elongation rate and elongation direction, with root
   component diameter also represented in some models. Almost all the
   three-dimensional models reviewed calculate the current direction of
   newly formed root segments using the previous direction of tip extension
   together with an angle related to geotropism.
   This review was carried out as the first stage in a research program on
   integrating root growth models with soil nutrient cycling models. For
   this purpose, the review suggests that, in order to optimize practical
   applications of these models in cropping systems, there is a need to
   integrate a number of additional processes, including root longevity and
   mortality, environmental responses, and effects of management such as
   tillage or the pesticide application regime. The form of root mortality
   relevant to nutrient cycling in soil is that due to natural senescence
   of root components. This differs from catastrophic death of roots due to
   attack by pathogenic fungi, which has been considered in one existing
   root model. To achieve the required objectives, there is also a need to
   strengthen the integration of above-ground plant component dynamics with
   root system development, particularly in relation to breeding new crop
   varieties for sustainable agricultural systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract                   = {Today, video streaming rose above all other traffic types over the
   internet. While providing this service with a high quality is the most
   challenging task, researchers are trying to solve the challenge by
   giving a more efficient network where congestion, broadband limitations
   and unsatisfied users are limited. In new multimedia based networks, new
   challenges move from technology-oriented services to user-oriented
   services which prove the importance of QoE. Service providers' growth
   depends nowadays not only on QoS parameters but also on clients' feeling
   and expectation. That is why; service providers must measure received
   QoE and this becomes a challenge regarding the evaluation of users'
   feeling. For users, qualitative perception differs from one user to
   another and service providers affront difficulties to transform the
   qualitative values into the quantitative one. The QoE evaluation needs
   more sophisticated methods to describe the real expectation of users.
   New multimedia applications provide at any user locations media who are
   sharing video, and communicating together in virtual network. These
   applications require providing the best possible QoE to consumers. When
   it comes to us, we present in this paper a machine learning approach
   combined with adaptive coding in order to provide a better QoE for video
   streaming services. This solution will be established using SDN
   architecture. We can justify this choice because we need a centralized
   architecture, where the totality of the network is known, to predict its
   status. So, we will implement a machine learning algorithm in the
   controller: this algorithm, called ML-based SSIM, will calculate
   approximately the quality needed for a video to be streamed. Finally,
   the quality found by the ML-based SSIM Algorithm will be combined with
   the network situation to choose the right coding. First part of the
   paper deals with an introduction of QoE requirement, metrics and
   protocols used especially in streaming services, then we give a complete
   study around Machine learning algorithms and other fields used in
   literature to enhance QoE. We define in this paper, at first, QoS and
   QoE, then the serving environment such as mobile cloud computing and
   software Defined Network (SDN). Then, we give both objective and
   subjective metrics, expose mathematical approaches used in modeling,
   predicting and evaluating QoE. Second, we expose the SSIM approach and
   explain how our proposed one is based on. The last part of the paper
   deals with experiments: we describe SDN environment deployment, describe
   scenarios and finally simulate on SDN emulator some topologies to
   demonstrate the impact of SDN components helping QoE measurement. At the
   end, we give the results and values. We highlight the future of our
   proposition.},

  abstract                   = {Professor Kuh is a pioneer and giant in physical layout. In this talk,
   we will describe his influence in placement. His pioneering work from
   interval graph for one dimensional gate assignment, BBL (Building-Block
   Layout System for Custom Chip IC Design) {[}2, 3, 6, 8], BEAR {[}7]
   layout system, BAGEL (Gate Array Layout) {[}17], RAMP (Resistive Analog
   Module Placement) {[}5], PROUD (Sea of Gates Placement) {[}28] to
   congestion, timing, and low power driven placement, Prof. Kuh always
   starts with innovative theoretical construction, software system
   building, and applications with impact on productivity.
   Physical layout is an indispensable software system for VLSI Design with
   millions of modules. Placement is the key component of about 500 million
   dollars market for physical synthesis. In the layout design flow, the
   placement is the core of the system integrating with other synthesis and
   analysis tools.
   For building block layout, Kuh's group tackled the nonslicing
   architecture. They devised the tile plane to represent the topology of
   the floorplan and the bottleneck of the routing. A routing order is
   derived to guarantee 100 percent routing completion {[}12]. The
   methodology and algorithms of building block placement {[}2] were
   adopted by companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation and ECAD,
   which was later renamed as Cadence.
   For standard cell placement, RAMP placement is devised using the analogy
   of a resistive network {[}12]. The minimization of the circuit power
   corresponds to the quadratic wire length reduction. The approach
   provides a convergent solution in the era of interconnect dominance. As
   the technology scales, interconnect becomes dominating the system
   performance in terms on delay and power consumption. Performance driven
   logic synthesis, signal interconnect with repeater insertion, power
   ground and clock distribution strongly rely on the physical layout
   information. On the other hand the placement requires the synthesis
   result to perform the task. This mutual dependence has caused serious
   design convergence issues in the 1990s.
   The work was performed at a time when simulated annealing method became
   a fashion in the EDA field. In 1983, Kirpatrick et al. {[}15] adopted
   the annealing method for placement and achieved excellent results. The
   annealing method takes the analogy of thermal annealing to perturb the
   partial solution with a probability according to the simulated
   temperature of the process. The strategy derives excellent results on
   some difficult problems at the expense of many random trials of the
   perturbations. Since most of EDA problem are known to be NP complete,
   annealing approach was considered as the right tool to solve the
   problem. Significant resources and efforts have thus been focused on
   annealing method in placement and other EDA subjects.
   The RAMP placement 5 method falls into the category of the analytical
   method. In 1979, Quinn and Breuer {[}23] introduced a force model to
   determine the state of equilibrium. They applied Hook's law to attract
   the modules connected by signal nets and repulsive forces to separate
   the modules with no connection. The repulsive forces cause a large set
   of nonlinear equations in the formulation, which complicates the
   calculation. An improvement has been proposed by Antreich, Johannes, and
   Kirsh {[}1] using the same force-directed method but with a more
   systematic formulation of equations. Kuh's approach removes the
   repulsive forces to simplify the nonlinear programming problem. His
   group demonstrated the feasibility of the global optimization approach
   via fast sparse matrix solvers {[}27]. The RAMP placement package was
   first installed at Hughes Aircraft Company to automate the placement in
   an in-house EDA project in 1983. The system had been used by the gate
   array design group since then. In 1988, in Kuh's group, Ren-Song Tsay
   developed PROUD to replace the matrix solver with successive over
   relaxation method. In 1992, at Cadence, CAD engineer, Louis Chao,
   implemented the algorithm and coined the placement tool as Qplacer to
   emphasize the usage of the quadratic cost function in the formulation.
   The Qplacer is the main placement tool of the ASIC design community for
   a long time. In the same year (1992), Ren-Song Tsay implemented the
   quadratic placement package at a start-up company which was later
   renamed as Avanti and acquired by Synopsys. The Qplacer became the main
   placement tool of the ASIC design community. Up to now, all major EDA
   companies, i.e. Cadence, Magma, Mentor Graphics, and Synopsys adopted
   the quadratic placement strategy and its extension by the group of
   Johannes. The placement is integrated with timing analysis and
   interconnect synthesis to provide convergent solutions for the
   designers.
   For the usage of the quadratic placement, it took 104 seconds at IMIPs
   machine to place 136 modules as the tool was installed at Hughes in
   1983. In 1991, Kleinhans et al. {[}16] reported to take 2500 seconds at
   15MIPs machine to place 6417 modules. In 1998, Eisenmann and Johannes
   {[}9] took 2031 seconds at Alphastation 250 4/266 (266MHz) to place 25K
   modules. As the quadratic placement method become popular, more features
   are integrated into the software package. In current designs, a state of
   art package can handle 6-7M components with 30-40 transistors. The limit
   is set by the memory capacity used for the analysis routine. Kuh's group
   has hosted a thriving set of Ph.D. students and visiting scholars to
   study placement. Margaret Sadowska has been a mentor to many in the
   group. The building block layout was contributed by Nang-Ping Chen,
   Chi-Ping Hsu, Chao-Chiang Chen, Wayne Dai, Bernhard Eschermann, Massoud
   Pedram, Yasushi Ogawa, and Margaret Sadowska. The channel ordering
   scheme for the layout {[}6] was published by Wayne Dai and Tetsuo Asano.
   The gate array layout {[}17] was constructed by Margaret Sadowska,
   Jeong-Tyng Li and C.K. Cheng. The standard placement has been studied by
   C.K. Cheng, Ren-Song Tsay; the low power placement by Massoud Pedram;
   the timing driven placement {[}9, 20] by Shen Lin, Srinivasan Arvind,
   Michael Jaskson, Henrik Esbensen, and Margaret Sadowska; the IO
   assignment {[}22] by Massoud Pedram, Narasimha Bhat, Kamal Chaudhary,
   Deborah Wang, and Margaret Sadowska. Dong-Min Xu developed gate matrix
   layout {[}29, 30]; Minshine Shih studied partitioning {[}29, 30];
   Pinhong Chen worked on floorplan sizing {[}4]; Hiroshi Murata extended a
   floorplan representation, sequence pair, to handle a mixture of soft and
   hard modules {[}18].
   As a second wave, renowned visiting scholars went back and continued to
   contribute to placement. Prof. Hidoshi Onodera used branch and bound
   approach for building block placement at Kyoto University in 1991
   {[}21]. Prof. Xianlong Hong devised an efficient floorplan
   representation, corner block list at Tsinghua University in 2000 {[}10].
   Prof. John Lillis devised a new placement tool, Mongrel using hybrid
   techniques for standard cell placement at University of Illinois,
   Chicago in 2000 {[}11]. Prof. Andrew B. Kahng's group at UC San Diego
   developed an APlacer which won ACM International Symposium on Physical
   Design placement contest in 2005 {[}13, 14]. At Kuh's group, we had the
   privilege to meet many leaders in placement, e.g. Satoshi Goto, Tatsuo
   Ohtsuki, Brian Preas, David Liu, T.C. Hu, Jerry Lee, Scott Kirkpatrick,
   Melvin A. Breuer, Ulrich Lauther, and Kurt Antreich.
   The placement with analogy of resistive network was inspired by Kuh's
   book entitled ``Basic Circuit Theory{''}. Kuh's group continues to
   investigate circuit analysis and synthesis. In 1991 {[}31], Shen Lin and
   Margaret Sadowska constructed an efficient timing simulator using a Step
   Wise Equivalent Conductance (SWEC) for nonlinear devices. In 1999
   {[}32], Janet Wang and Qingjian Yu simplified transmission line analysis
   using model order reduction. In recent years (2005-2009), Kuh has
   advised analysis and synthesis of transmission lines using passive
   equalizer {[}33-38] and circuit simulation techniques {[}39-41].
   VLSI placement is a challenge task with the increasing complexity of the
   circuit. The size of the modular placement cases scales with the advance
   of VLSI technologies. In 1961, Steinberg introduced a case of 34
   modules. In 1972, Stevens in his thesis posted the ILLIAC IV boards with
   67-151 modules {[}26]. In 1983, the test case from Hughes ranges from
   300 to 500 modules. By 1991, the largest test case released by MCNC
   Center for Microelectronics is 15K modules. Moreover, subjects in
   placement such as mixed module placement, placement of heterogeneous
   circuits, placement integrating with behavior synthesis, 3-dimensional
   placement, and parallel placement are related to geometry handling,
   circuit performance, and advancement of the technologies and call for
   further study in the field.},

  abstract  = {We propose a continuous-time stochastic model for the dynamics of a limit order book. The model strikes a balance between three desirable features: it can be estimated easily from data, it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics, and its analytical tractability allows for fast computation of various quantities of interest without resorting to simulation. We describe a simple parameter estimation procedure based on high-frequency observations of the order book and illustrate the results on data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Using simple matrix computations and Laplace transform methods, we are able to efficiently compute probabilities of various events, conditional on the state of the order book: an increase in the midprice, execution of an order at the bid before the ask quote moves, and execution of both a buy and a sell order at the best quotes before the price moves. Using high-frequency data, we show that our model can effectively capture the short-term dynamics of a limit order book. We also evaluate the performance of a simple trading strategy based on our results.},

  abstract    = {"This book develops the use of Monte Carlo methods in finance, and it also uses simulation as a vehicle for presenting models and ideas from financial engineering. It divides roughly into three parts. The first part develops the fundamentals of Monte Carlo methods, the foundations of derivatives pricing, and the implementation of several of the most important models used in financial engineering. The next part describes techniques for improving simulation accuracy and efficiency. The final third of the book addresses special topics: estimating price sensitivities, valuing American options, and measuring market risk and credit risk in financial portfolios." "The most important prerequisite is familiarity with the mathematical tools used to specify and analyze continuous time models in finance, in particular the key ideas of stochastic calculus. Prior exposure to the basic principles of option pricing is useful but not essential." "The book is aimed at graduate students in financial engineering, researchers in Monte Carlo simulation, and practitioners implementing models in industry."--Jacket.},
